The friendship functionality app folder:
https://github.com/revsys/django-friendship


We comment out the ShootA-views.py:
"""
from django.core.mail import send_mail
send_mail('InfoTrack:Reset Password', 'Welcome to InfoTrack!', 'compsci326326@gmail.com',
    ['qzhao@umass.com'], fail_silently=False)
"""

But in case you want to reset email by sending email you should remove the comment.
PLEASE use a new registered gmail as sender instead of compsci326326@gmail.com (which is only for our team not for TA grading!)
When you have the new registered gmail make two changes:
1. In ShootA-views.py replaced 'compsci326326@gmail.com' with your new registered gamil.
2. In ShootA-settings.py replaced 
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'compsci326326@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD= 'qwe123456789'
to your new registered gmail.


Single Slide and Presentation Slide are attached on moodle .txt file. Also Royce already sent the copies of links to TA.
